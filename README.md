This is a small chrome extension used for quickly looking up stocks. I'm annoyed at how existing apps make you jump through hoops.  I'm also not implementing ads at this point because I don't think my tiny user base needs to see ads for the five cents a month it'd bring me haha.

This app has a few main tasks:

* `Retrieve stocks` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
* `Save stock list` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).
