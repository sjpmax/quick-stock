This project is for the Chrome Extension EZ Stock. It was created using "Create React App" and Bootstrap. It utilizes RobinHood API. 

As of 4/2018, it only retrieves most U.S. equities and exchange traded funds (ETFs) listed on major U.S. exchanges.

Current functionality: Retrieves stocks from a user entered list, shows the change in price of the stock from the opening bell to the current time. Green means the stock has risen in price, red means that it has fallen.
